# 2024 Study Group

The study group was originally running from February to April 2024 as an open, 10-week study program. Although these regular presentations are over, all of the content produced is available here and the community is still active. Learn more context in the [original announcement](https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/02/07/epf-study-group). 

## Program Structure

The study group content is structured in 2 stages of weekly presentations. To follow the study group, you can watch presentations and read related resources week by week. 

The first half is dedicated to general understanding of the internal mechanisms of the protocol, its architecture and basic concepts. The second half offers 2 different tracks - development and research. Presentations in each track offer a deeper dive into specific topics within the R&D domains.  

Each session is led by core developer or researcher, comes with reading materials to get you familiar with the topic context and some also include exercises to strengthen  and practice your understanding.

Weekly sessions, their presentations and materials can be all found in this section under Presentations. 

### Presentations 

The first part of the program consists of 6 sessions with introductions to high level domains of the protocol. 

> Because some speakers did more technical talks than others, the recommended order for newcomers to start is Week 1, Week 3, Week 2, Week 5 Node workshop and then Week 4 and 5.
