## Pre-reading

Before starting with the Day 16 content, make yourself familiar with resources in previous weeks, especially day 2 on CL and day 6 on specs (at least the CL part). You should have general understanding of Beacon Chain and different mechanism in Ethereum consensus layer. 

Additionally, you can get ready by studying the following resources.

- Vitalik's [Beacon Chain Fork Choice](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/fork-choice.md) - outdated, but still excellent
- [Consensus chapter](https://eth2book.info/latest/part2/consensus/) in the Upgrading Ethereum book
- [Annotated spec on fork choice](https://eth2book.info/latest/part3/forkchoice/phase0/)
