# Execution Client

> **Execution clients**, formerly known as *eth1 clients*, are tasked with processing and broadcasting transactions and managing Ethereum's state.
They run the computations for each transaction using the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) to ensure that the rules of the protocol are followed.
Execution clients can be configured as archive nodes, which retain the entire history of the blockchain, or as full (pruned) nodes, which keep only the latest state and discard older data to save storage space.


### Besu
Developed by the Hyperledger Foundation in Java, Besu (Hyperledger Besu) is distinguished for its enterprise-grade features and compatibility with various Hyperledger projects.
It supports both public and private networks such as Rinkeby, Ropsten, and Goerli, offering robust command-line tools and a JSON-RPC API.
