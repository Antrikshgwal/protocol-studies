# Consensus Client

> **Consensus clients**, formerly known as *eth2 clients*, run Ethereum's proof-of-stake consensus algorithm allowing the network to reach agreement about the head of the Beacon Chain. Consensus clients do not participate in validating/broadcasting transactions or executing state transitions: that is done by execution clients. Consensus clients do not attest to, or propose new blocks: that is done by the validator client which is an optional add-on to the consensus client.


### Lighthouse
Lighthouse, written in Rust by Sigma Prime, emphasizes security and performance. It's widely adopted but caution is advised as a supermajority could potentially lead to chain splits.
Lighthouse is licensed under Apache 2.0 and known for its robustness in production environments.
